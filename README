kristian-emacs-minimal is my (kristian) attempt to make a portable GNU
Emacs repo which can be used on all computers I currently need an
awesome editor on. Which is all running Arch Linux at moment, but I
will attempt to NOT make it bound to either Arch or Linux. 

This repo is the first git, or any other version control repository
for that matter, I have ever made. In addition to learn Emacs and
Emacs lisp, I hope to develop an understanding of git and getting into
good habits while working with a VCS. (I'm Norwegian, so if my english
don't make sense to you, that's the reason. A spellchecker can correct
misspelled words, but don't make you write more intelligent
sentences).

Phil Hagelberg have written and published emacs-starter-kit on github
(see http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/tree/master)
which is my inspiration for publishing my own. Not likely that my will
be as popular as Phil's. But if you like how I do stuff, feel free to
clone the repo and contribute.

Happy hacking!
